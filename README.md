# Google Sheets Sync ‚Äì Figma plugin

Welcome üëã

This is a new home for keeping track of all things related to my ['Google Sheets Sync' Figma Plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/735770583268406934/Google-Sheets-Sync).

I was getting bombarded with various emails, Twitter DMs and comments on Figma; I couldn't keep track of it all and keep it consolidated ‚Äî so I'm starting again, to keep it all here for all to see!

*(A huge apology to anyone that went out of your way to contact me and never heard back; I definitely read it, and am super sorry I never replied. I'm trying to be better and get on top of things now ü§ó)*
